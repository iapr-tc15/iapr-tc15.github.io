### Description
Graphs play a crucial role in different fields in modeling complex structures composed of entities and their relationships, including dynamic domains where these relationships can evolve over time. Notable examples of graph-based representations and processing can be found in biology, where the structures of molecules and proteins are naturally modeled as graphs; social sciences, where graphs are used to model interactions between individuals or groups; data science, where graphs enhance recommendation systems by tracking user-item interactions; and transportation, where graphs are employed to model the evolution of traffic flow over time.

Neural models on graphs enable adaptive solutions for a wide range of learning tasks on graph data, avoiding the need for hand-engineered features or domain-specific knowledge. This capability has driven significant progress in applying machine learning to graph-based problems across various research fields. As a result, the design, optimization, and analysis of these graph-based learning models have become central to cutting-edge research, while also presenting a range of open challenges that continue to shape the field's future directions.
