4. **Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Research Teams**

    TC15 is committed to fostering diversity within research teams by encouraging participation from underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and researchers from low-resource regions. All researchers should make efforts to involve a broad range of perspectives in their work, creating inclusive research environments that support the development of junior researchers and those from diverse backgrounds.

   
5. **Responsible Peer Review and Editorial Practices**

    Members of TC15 are expected to participate in peer review with integrity and fairness.

Conflicts of interest must be declared to ensure fairness in the evaluation of othersâ€™ work.

   
6. **Fair and Transparent Data Sharing**

    Researchers within TC15 are encouraged to share data, software, and other resources in a manner that promotes transparency and reproducibility in scientific research. When sharing or using datasets, researchers must ensure that proper permissions are obtained and that all contributors are acknowledged. Collaborative research should be approached with open communication regarding data ownership and future use.

    
7. **Zero Tolerance for Harassment in Research Settings**

    Harassment or discrimination of any kind, including in academic discussions, collaborations, or during conferences and workshops, will not be tolerated. All researchers must engage in discussions and critiques of research in a professional and respectful manner, avoiding personal attacks and fostering an environment of constructive feedback.

Participants should feel safe and free to engage fully in TC15 activities.

   
10. **Supporting Open Science and Reproducibility**

   TC15 encourages its members to support open science practices by sharing research outputs, such as code, data, and findings, with the wider community to promote reproducibility. This openness should be balanced with appropriate respect for intellectual property and collaboration agreements.
